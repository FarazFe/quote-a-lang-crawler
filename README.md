# quote-a-lang-crawler
Hello! Welcome to this repository!  This project is aimed for helping people learn new languages using quotes. It currently is powered by a Python web crawler which fetches data from WikiQuotes and adds it to the DB.  We're looking for help in order to expand the number of languages supported by the app (currently, we're able to fetch only quotes in French), possibly implementing integrations for social networks and SRS systems, as well as (futurally) having our own approach to it.
